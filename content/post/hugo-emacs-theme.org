I've been using [[https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal][hugo-theme-terminal]] for my blog and really liked its clean, terminal-inspired aesthetic. But as someone who spends most of their day in Emacs, I wanted something that felt more like home.

So I vibe coded an Emacs-style theme with Claude. The entire thing - HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript interactions - was built through conversation with AI.

* Features

- Dired-style article list with reading time, word count, and dates
- Window splitting with =C-x 2= (vertical) and =C-x 3= (horizontal)
- Navigate with =n/p=, open with =RET=, go back with =q=
- Modus Vivendi (dark) and Modus Operandi (light) themes, toggle with =t=
- Emacs modeline showing buffer name, scroll position, and mode
- Even has a working menu bar

* The Result

The theme is available at [[https://github.com/ArthurHeymans/hugo-emacs-theme][github.com/ArthurHeymans/hugo-emacs-theme]].

One less reason to leave Emacs - now even my blog looks like it.
